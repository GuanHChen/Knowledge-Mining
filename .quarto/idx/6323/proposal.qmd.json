Specifically, in data-driven societies, the protection of citizen data is a growing concern. Policy interventions such as various state data breach disclosure laws (NCSL 2022) have emerged as tools to ensure transparency and better governance of personal data. Inspired by studies such as Gay’s (2017) and Sullivan’s (2010), this project will look at the public sector to ascertain the strength of correlations between select financial metrics and whether a city government was hacked or not (i.e., a binary-dependent variable). If we find statistically significant relationships via our slated approaches, we may further analyze the effects of cyberattacks on the overall financial performance of the affected entities.\n\n#### Background\n\nAccording to Privacy Rights.org’s 2023 report on data breaches, there have been 20,030 data breaches in the U.S. since 2005 that have leaked out a total of 1,993,415,481 records. The main sources of breaches are direct hacks, ransomware attacks, and third-party breaches. This means an individual’s personally identifiable information (PII), such as their name, full social security number, date of birth, address, ID numbers, medical history, banking information, and other undisclosed records, are possibly compromised or stolen. Such events victimize individuals and put them at risk of falling victim to identity and/or financial fraud. Billions of compromised individual records, with an average cost of \\$9.44 million per breach (Morgan Lewis 2022), have posed and continue to pose a great economic burden on both the private and public sectors. Yet, there are few studies that have analyzed the characteristics of governments that are targets of cyber-attacks, a gap we hope to fill with this project.\n\n#### Methodology\n\nFinancial data will be derived from the Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) dataset, a product of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). Breach data will be acquired from various state-wide disclosures. We plan to use unsupervised methods such as K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Principal Components Analysis (Sohil et al. 2022, ch. 12-13) in order to help tease apart relationships between all our data. We will also use various supervised machine learning methods such as logistic, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree-based, and support vector machines classification methods, along with polynomial and spline regression (Sohil et al. 2022, ch. 4-9) in order to find information concerning any structured relationships between these variables. Specifically using the fact of a local government experiencing a breach or not as our dependent variable. Additionally, we plan on using re-sampling methods such as cross-validation and bootstrapping (Sohil et al. 2022, ch. 5) to test the strength of various approaches. This research will seek to contribute to policy analysis more generally by identifying patterns and correlations that elucidate the evolving role of digitalization in the context of modern governance. Of course, the results of our findings will be limited to the locales we study and not directly generalizable to other cities, states, nations, etc.\n\n#### References\n\nGay, Sebastien. 2017. “Strategic News Bundling and Privacy Breach Disclosures.” Journal of Cybersecurity 3(2): 91–108. doi:10.1093/cybsec/tyx009.
